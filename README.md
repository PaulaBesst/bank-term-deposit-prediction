# üè¶ Term Deposit Prediction Model

A machine learning project that predicts whether a bank client will subscribe to a term deposit based on marketing campaign data. Built with Python, Scikit-learn, and deployed with Streamlit.

## Project Overview

This project analyzes bank marketing campaign data to predict client subscription to term deposits using machine learning algorithms. The model helps banks optimize their marketing strategies by identifying clients most likely to subscribe.

## Dataset

- **Records**: 41,188 client interactions
- **Original Features**:  20 input variables plus target variable 
- **Target**: Binary classification (subscribe/not subscribe)
- **Time Period**: Banking campaign data
- **Class Distribution**: Imbalanced dataset (~11.3% positive class)

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values and categorical encoding
- **Class Imbalance**: Uses SMOTE oversampling technique
- **Multiple Models**: Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression
- **Feature Engineering**: Focused selection of key banking features
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Streamlit web application for predictions

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Imbalanced-learn
- **Data Analysis**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Web App**: Streamlit
- **Deployment**: Streamlit Community Cloud

## Model Performance

The project evaluates three machine learning models:

| Model | Features | Technique |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| Random Forest | Ensemble method with class balancing | `class_weight='balanced'` |
| XGBoost | Gradient boosting with scale balancing | `scale_pos_weight` |
| Logistic Regression | Linear model with class weights | `class_weight='balanced'` |

**Best Model Selection**: Automatically selects the model with highest ROC AUC score.

## Key Features Used

The model focuses on 13 key banking features:

- **Client Demographics**: Age, job, marital status, education
- **Campaign Data**: Duration, campaign contacts, previous contacts
- **Economic Indicators**: Employment rate, consumer price index, Euribor rate
- **Previous Outcomes**: Results from previous campaigns

## Results & Insights

### Feature Importance
The analysis reveals the most predictive features for term deposit subscription:

1. **Call Duration** - Most important predictor
2. **Economic Indicators** - Significant impact on decisions
3. **Previous Campaign Results** - Strong predictive power
4. **Client Demographics** - Age and job category influence

### Business Recommendations

1. **Focus on Call Quality**: Longer, meaningful conversations increase conversion
2. **Economic Timing**: Align campaigns with favorable economic conditions
3. **Leverage History**: Use previous interaction data for targeting
